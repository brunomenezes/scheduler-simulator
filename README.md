Scheduler Simulator
============

####Rules to Follow on solution Development
* Create process-like data structure 
* The structure should has[id, name, priority, CPU_burst_time[…], IO_burst_time[…]]
* The scheduler should do:
   * Preemption if the current process on processor is less prior then a process on the ready queue
   * Aging on all processes in the ready queue after every 10 u.t.
